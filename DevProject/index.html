    <h1>Chris Scurr</h1>
<p>I'm learning to code on Codecademy! My goals include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learn to code</li>
    <li>Create web apps</li>
    <li>Help business owners make more money</li>
</ul>
<p>After running my own ecommerce website, I've decided there's an opportunity to create some apps on the Shopify platform which either aren't there or could better. 
    <br>My current eccomerce site is: <a href="https://www.fountaingardens.co.uk/" target="_blank">Fountain Gardens</a></p>
